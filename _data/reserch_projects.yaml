  description: Circulatory shock, particularly septic shock, is a life-threatening condition characterized by impaired tissue perfusion and a high risk of organ failure. Conventional intensive care monitoring focuses on macro-hemodynamic parameters such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), which may not reflect the state of microvascular perfusion. High-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy (hr-NIRS) enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of tissue hemoglobin dynamics, offering potential insight into regional microvascular function. This thesis presents two complementary analyses using hr-NIRS in critically ill patients: (1) derivation of optimal MAP (MAPopt) from skeletal muscle autoregulation signals, and (2) wavelet-based quantification of microvascular and cardiac power from NIRS signals. The study included 15 mechanically ventilated ICU patients (MAPopt study) requiring vasopressors, and 43 critically ill patients (wavelet study), along with 14 healthy volunteers recruited from a parallel study. MAPopt was derived using correlation indices between arterial pressure and NIRS signals in both skeletal muscle and brain. Muscle-derived MAPopt values moderately correlated with cerebral MAPopt (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), demonstrating the feasibility of peripheral autoregulation assessment. Notably, most muscle MAPopt values were below the standard clinical threshold of 65 mmHg, suggesting that conventional MAP targets may overestimate optimal perfusion pressure in some patients. Wavelet analysis demonstrated that microvascular power was significantly lower in ICU patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001), while cardiac power did not differ significantly. Subgroup analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in microvascular or cardiac power between survivors and non-survivors or between septic and non-septic patients. However, patients receiving vasopressors on day 1 exhibited significantly reduced microvascular power compared to those not receiving pressors (p < 0.05), particularly early in their ICU stay. These findings support the feasibility of deriving MAPopt from skeletal muscle and highlight the value of wavelet-based microvascular metrics in distinguishing physiologic states. Together, these techniques offer a promising framework for individualized hemodynamic monitoring and may enhance resuscitation strategies in critical care.

  description: Physiological coherence between organ-specific microvascular hemodynamics is a fundamental yet underexplored aspect of human systemic blood flow regulation, particularly in systemic vascular diseases such as critical illness. Current critical care monitoring predominantly relies on systemic macro-hemodynamic parameters, which fail to capture the heterogeneity and dynamic relationships of microvascular perfusion across organs like brain and skeletal muscle. This knowledge gap is especially evident regarding the temporal and frequency-specific coherence of microvascular signals between these organs, limiting the development of targeted, organ-specific therapies. To address this, we developed a novel methodological framework to quantify physiological coherence between brain and skeletal muscle microcirculation using high-resolution Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (hr-NIRS) and advanced wavelet-based signal processing. This study employed continuous, non-invasive monitoring in ICU patients (n=40) and healthy controls (n=15), simultaneously acquiring total hemoglobin (HbT) from the frontal cortex and brachioradialis, along with systemic blood pressure. Time-frequency and time-phasic relationships were characterized using wavelet coherence and semblance analyses, assessing both the strength and synchrony of microvascular coupling across cardiac and microvascular frequency bands. Key findings include: (i) ICU patients exhibited significantly reduced coherence duration and phase synchrony between brain and skeletal muscle microcirculation in the cardiac frequency band compared to healthy controls; (ii) ICU non-survivors demonstrated excessive synchronization between skeletal muscle microcirculation and systemic blood pressure in the microvascular and cardiac frequency bands compared to ICU survivors. These results establish, for the first time, that dynamic physiological coherence between brain and skeletal muscle microcirculation is significantly altered in critical illness, with distinct patterns associated with patient outcomes. Integrating wavelet-based coherence metrics into bedside monitoring offers a promising direction for the development of novel biomarkers to guide personalized therapeutic strategies and risk stratification in the ICU.
