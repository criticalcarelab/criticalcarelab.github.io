## Biography

Dr. Asher Mendelson is an assistant professor in the Max Rady College of Medicine's Department of Internal Medicine, section of Critical Care Medicine, at the University of Manitoba. He is cross-appointed with the Department of Immunology at UM and with Biomedical Engineering at the Price Faculty of Engineering.

Dr. Mendelson is an accomplished clinician-scientist, specializing in critical care and internal medicine. Born in Montreal, Canada, his passion for both health sciences and music led him to pursue a degree in health sciences and music at Marianopolis College. He went on to attend medical school at McGill University and completed residency training in internal medicine at the University of British Columbia. Along the way, he also earned a masterâ€™s degree in experimental medicine, designing novel osmotic agents for peritoneal dialysis as his thesis.

Dr. Mendelson continued his training at Western University, completing fellowship training in critical care, and later received his PhD in medical biophysics, focusing on applied microvascular physiology and oxygen delivery in sepsis.

Now at the forefront of research in microvascular physiology and sepsis in critical care, Dr. Mendelson utilizes advanced biomedical optics and signal analysis to diagnose and treat cardiovascular failure in the ICU, and uses small animal models to study sepsis pathogenesis. He is the co-lead of the National Preclinical Sepsis Platform and an active member of several Canadian research networks in critical care.

When he's not at work in the lab and clinic, Dr. Mendelson enjoys cooking, hiking, traveling with his wife Rachel, and playing with his cats, Leo and Sterling.
